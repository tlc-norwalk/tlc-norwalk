                        We believe in the Triune God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, who created all that exists; became man in the person of
                        Jesus Christ to suffer, die, and rise again for the worldâ€™s redemption; and brings people to faith and new life through
                        His Word and Sacraments.
                    </p>
                    <p class="uk-heading-bullet">
                        We believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God; without error and the only norm and rule of faith and practice.

                    <p class="uk-heading-bullet">
                        We believe that the church is not a building, but the people who gather in community to worship, pray and serve.

                    <p class="uk-heading-bullet">
                        We believe that we are all, by nature, sinful and unclean and thus in need of a savior.

                    <p class="uk-heading-bullet">
                        We believe that we are saved, not by works, but by the grace of God from which our desire to serve blooms.
                    <p class="uk-heading-bullet">
                        We believe that as children of God we all have value and are beloved Author and Creator of Heaven and Earth.
